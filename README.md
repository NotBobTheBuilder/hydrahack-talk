hydrahack talk
==============

This repo contains the presentation, demos & code samples for my talk at Hydrahack on March 18.

Code samples are in sensibly named branches, ordered by their appearance in the presentation.

The presentation is available in the gh-pages branch or [here](http://notbobthebuilder.github.io/hydrahack-talk)
